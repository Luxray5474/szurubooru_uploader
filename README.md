# szurubooru_uploader

## *An upload and tagging helper for szurubooru.*

Being an owner of my own local szurubooru server, I became annoyed about the inflexibility of the web interface for uploading images to a szurubooru server, most significantly:

  * You cannot tag files on upload, you must do them afterwards
  * You cannot [easily] set safety for multiple files at once, you must click on each and every one
  * File metadata isn't detected

This application looks to solve those.

This application uses PyQt5; that's the only dependency.

In the future I might port this to C++ for more performance.

Also sorry for the crappy code, this is one of my first Python projects. Please feel free to throw some recomendations or optimizations.
