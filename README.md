# szurubooru_uploader

## *An upload and tagging helper for szurubooru.*

Being an owner of my own local szurubooru server, I became annoyed about the inflexibility of the web interface for uploading images to a szurubooru server, most significantly:

  * You cannot tag files on upload, you must do them afterwards
  * You cannot [easily] set safety for multiple files at once, you must click on each and every one
  * File metadata isn't detected

This application looks to solve those.

Also sorry for the crappy code, this is one of my first Python projects. Please feel free to throw some recomendations or optimizations.
